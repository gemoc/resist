RESIST_EA gathers the following members of the [DiverSE team](http://diverse.irisa.fr/) ([Inria](https://www.inria.fr/), FR) and 
the [VIAS and COMPLEX teams](https://www.simula.no/research/software-engineering) ([Simula](https://www.simula.no), NO).

* **[Mathieu Acher](https://www.mathieuacher.com/), Professor, Inria and INSA Rennes/IUF, France (Co-PI)** Mathieu's research interests include variability and configurable systems, machine learning, and performance testing, applied in the context of software-intensive systems. He will contribute to RESIST by providing expertise on multimorphic testing and AI-based management of software variability/configurations.
* [Benoit Combemale](https://www.irit.fr/~Benoit.Combemale/), Professor, Inria and Univ. Rennes 1, France. Benoit
research interests include model driven software engineering (MDE), software language engineering (SLE) and software validation & verification (V&V); mostly applied in the context of (smart) cyber-physical systems and Internet of things. He will contribute to RESIST by providing expertise on the modelling continuum and digital twins. 
* [Paul Temple](https://templep.github.io/), Associate Professor, Inria and Univ. Rennes 1, France. Paul is tackling new challenges about software engineering, software testing, software variability and machine learning.
* [Olivier Barais](https://olivier.barais.fr), Professor, Inria and Univ. Rennes 1, France
* [Xhevahire Tërnava](https://ternava.github.io/), post-doc, University of Rennes 1 with expertise in variability and feature engineering, software debloating, and automated software engineering 
* [Aaron RANDRIANAINA](https://perso.eleves.ens-rennes.fr/people/georges-aaron.randrianaina/), PhD student, University of Rennes 1 with expertise in incremental build of software (configurations) and variability in general 


* **[Arnaud Gotlieb](https://www.simula.no/people/arnaud), Research Professor, Simula Research Laboratory, Norway (Co-PI)**
Head of the VIAS Dept. (Validation Intelligence of Autonomous Software Systems) with expertise in Software Validation and Verification of software-intensive systems and Artificial Intelligence for Software Testing. His recent research interests include the usage of constraint optimization and machine learning to improve software testing processes.
* [Helge Spieker](https://www.simula.no/people/helge), VIAS Dept., Research Scientist with expertise in artificial intelligence (Machine Learning, Constraint Optimization) and software testing.
* [Quentin Mazouni](https://www.simula.no/people/quentin), PhD at SIMULA (since Aug. 2022), VIAS Dept., working on the validation of AI planning systems. 

* [Shaukat Ali](https://www.simula.no/people/shaukat), Head of Department of the COMPLEX department Simula with expertise in (1) CPS modeling, development, and testing; (2) Digital twins  
* [Qinghua Xu](https://www.simula.no/people/qinghua/) PhD student at the COMPLEX department working on building digital twins for CPS security for operational time analyses.
