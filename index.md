The associated team Resilient Software Science (RESIST_EA) will research the foundations of “Resilient Software” – software systems which can resist failures without significantly degrading their functionality. Over the past years, resilient software systems have become extremely important in various application domains. By combining Inria’s and Simula´s expertise in software engineering, resilient software, and AI-based software testing, the RESIST_EA associate team will address the following challenges:
- Utilizing observation data for assessing resilience under varying conditions
- Digital twins for continuous improvement of resilient autonomous/smart systems
- Resilient autonomous systems in the digital and physical world

The goal of the RESIST_EA associate team is to explore the science of resilient software by foundational work on advanced a priori testing methods such as metamorphic testing and a posteriori continuous improvements through digital twins. 

The RESIST_EA associate team will be composed of sixteen researchers, ten from the Simula departments VIAS and COMPLEX within the [Software Engineering](https://www.simula.no/research/software-engineering) area and six researchers from the [DiverSE team](http://diverse.irisa.fr/) at Inria Rennes. The associate team will be jointly led by Associate Professor [Mathieu Acher](https://www.mathieuacher.com/) at the University of Rennes, and Research Professor [Arnaud Gotlieb](https://www.simula.no/people/arnaud) from Simula in Norway.

Here are a few pointers:
 * the scientific content (problems solved, tasks performed) can be found through slides (see Github repo https://github.com/gemoc/resist or titles of talks in [Activities](activities)) and papers (see [publications](publications)) 
 * activities (visits, organisation of events, etc.) is available in [Activities](activities)
 * the outcome of RESIST (publications, software, manuscripts, theses, masters, conference posters, etc.) is available in [publications](publications)

**BREAKING NEWS** RESIST_EA three full-days Workshop has been held at KA23 around Mar. 29th, 2022. Another two full-days workshop happen in November 2022 at Inria (see https://gemoc.org/resist/events/resistAtInriaNov2022).
