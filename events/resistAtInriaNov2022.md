### Digital twins

9AM - 9:45AM: Shaukat 
* a presentation of the "internships" you discuss with Benoit/Djamel at Dagsthul 
* a presentation by Benoit (eg reusing material for keynote) 
* a brainstorm about DT and RESIST
  * eg can we envision to have "real-world/physical" systems with a DT? eg DTs for robots playing soccer 
  * connection of DT with "planning problems" and "self-driving cars-like systems" (other systems discussed in RESIST) 
  * towards a demonstrator of RESIST
