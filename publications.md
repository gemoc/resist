# Theses

Quentin Mazouni has succesfully defended his Master's thesis work at INSA Rennes. His work includes the production of datasets and reproducible scripts. He is now a PhD student at Simula (since Aug. 2022), working on the validation of AI planning systems under the co-supervision of Arnaud Gotlieb (Simula), Helge Spieker (Simula) and Mathieu Acher (Inria)

Luc Lesoil has successfully defended his PhD thesis, with many results coming from RESIST discussions, including datasets, reproducible scripts, and papers.
